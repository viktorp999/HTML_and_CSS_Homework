      Fulham, West London, England. They compete in the Premier League, the top
      tier of English football. Founded in 1905, the team play their home games
      at Stamford Bridge. The club won their first major honour, the League
      championship, in 1955. They won the FA Cup for the first time in 1970, won
      their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971, and became the
      third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. Chelsea is one of
      five clubs and the first English club to have won all three pre-1999 main
      European club competitions, the "European Treble" of the European Cup/UEFA
      Champions League, European/UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa
      League. They are the only club to have won all three major European
      competitions twice. They are the only London club to have won the
      Champions League and the Club World Cup. Domestically, the club has won
      six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community
      Shields. Internationally, they have won the UEFA Champions League, the
      UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice

      Chelsea is the fifth-most successful club in English football. The club
      has rivalries with neighbouring teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, and a
      historic rivalry with Leeds United. In terms of club value, Chelsea is the
      ninth-most-valuable football club in the world (as of 2024), worth $3.13

    <h2>Short History</h2>

    <p>
      In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in
      Fulham with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to
      lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found
      his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham
      in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for
      the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC
      were considered. Chelsea F.C. was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising
      Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance
      to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League
      shortly afterwards.

            Chelsea Football Club is an English professional football club based
            in Fulham, West London, England. They compete in the Premier League,
            the top tier of English football. Founded in 1905, the team play
            their home games at Stamford Bridge. The club won their first major
            honour, the League championship, in 1955. They won the FA Cup for
            the first time in 1970, won their first European honour, the Cup
            Winners' Cup, in 1971, and became the third English club to win the
            Club World Cup in 2022. Chelsea is one of five clubs and the first
            English club to have won all three pre-1999 main European club
            competitions, the "European Treble" of the European Cup/UEFA
            Champions League, European/UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/UEFA
            Europa League. They are the only club to have won all three major
            European competitions twice. They are the only London club to have
            won the Champions League and the Club World Cup. Domestically, the
            club has won six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and
            four FA Community Shields. Internationally, they have won the UEFA
            Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup
            and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once.
            In terms of overall trophies won, Chelsea is the fifth-most
            successful club in English football. The club has rivalries with
            neighbouring teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, and a historic
            rivalry with Leeds United. In terms of club value, Chelsea is the
            ninth-most-valuable football club in the world (as of 2024), worth
            $3.13 billion, and is the ninth-highest-earning football club in the
            world.

            In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in
            Fulham with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer
            to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to
            found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team
            named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of
            Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC,
            Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were considered. Chelsea F.C. was
            founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's
            Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on
            Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly
            afterwards.
